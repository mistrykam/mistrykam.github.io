                        <p class="card-text">
                            A pair of Gucci shoes, a Louis Vuitton purse and Prada jacket will make you look rich but not wealthy.
                            <br /><br />
                            We all like to look good and feel good. How incredible would it feel to slip into a pair of hand-made Italian designed
                            shoes, jump into a shiny new limited edition aqua blue 480hp, V8 Maserati with advanced driver assist, and cruise down the
                            highway with the wind blowing in your hair. Then return to your newly renovated 4000 square feet luxury home with heated
                            floors, a marbled kitchen and a media room hosting the latest 85 inch 8K Samsung TV. Welcome to the good life!
                            <br /><br />
                            If you bumped into this person with this lifestyle your immediate reaction might be that they are extremely wealthy. They
                            have it made, they must be on easy street. And If I work a little harder, climb the corporate ladder, I too can have a
                            piece of the good life.
                            <br /><br />
                            In the majority of cases, it is just a facade. Peak behind the red velvet curtains and you see the ugly pile of debt,
                            sleepless nights of stress and the pressure of keeping up appearances.
                            <br /><br />
                            And the goal of obtaining these prized high-end luxury consumer goods is for status (or as the Tik-Tokers says flexing).
                            These items are a signal to the world that “I am extremely successful, I am rich, I am special, (and in some cases) I am
                            better than you!” The price of seeking status is the ever-growing credit card bills, the line of credits and the monster
                            mortgage. I know, YOLO, you only once, my twenty thousand Instagram followers want to see my next status purchase.
                            <br /><br />
                            Naval Ravikant, the CEO and co-founder of AngelList dropped this <a target="_blank"
                                href="https://twitter.com/naval/status/1002103360646823936">tweet</a> back in May 2018: <i>Seek wealth, not money or
                                status. Wealth is having assets that earn while you sleep. Money is how we transfer time and wealth. Status is your
                                place in the social hierarchy.</i>
                            <br /><br />
                            The wealth that you should seek:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Health - learn about nutrition and exercise, how to have high energy</li>
                                <li>Financial Literacy - banking, taxes, managing income and expenses</li>
                                <li>Communication - how to listen, understand, persuade, negotiate and present ideas</li>
                                <li>Income Generation - beyond working 9-5, starting a business, investing</li>
                                <li>Education - continuous learning, Google/YouTube/books has opened knowledge that were locked in stuffy textbooks
                                    and high tuition institutions</li>
                                <li>Time - the most precious and limited resource we have </li>
                            </ul>
                            When you focus on wealth generation you become more valuable and hence society becomes more valuable. When you focus on
                            status you make a multinational corporation richer while it makes your poorer.

                        <p class="card-text">
                            I can't write. I am a terrible writer.
                            <br /><br />
                            I don't have the ability to express my thoughts.
                            <br /><br />
                            Words and sentences are challenging for me to write.
                            <br /><br />
                            And don't get me started on spelling, if the word contains more than five letters, it might as well be Greek or Klingon.
                            <br /><br />
                            Words are strange creatures, we spell "know" the same way we spell "no". How can "I know you said 'no' when I <i>asked</i>
                            you if you <i>axed</i> that tree.', be valid?
                            <br /><br />
                            I struggle, like a person drowning in the ocean, trying to breathe out a series of words while being swamped with facts
                            and ideas. Someone, please throw me a life jacket.
                            <br /><br />
                            I'm told to shift my state into writer’s mode, like when Michael Jordan gets into the zone before an important playoff
                            game. As if writing and basketball are the same sport!
                            <br /><br />
                            Why is writing so hard? Why can't I make sense of something that I have been taught to do since I was three? Is my brain
                            missing the 'writing app', “Hey Siri, help me to write!”
                            <br /><br />
                            I can do this. I have the ability to write.
                            <br /><br />
                            I can take facts and ideas and translate them into sentences that can move a person to tears, prove that gravity exists,
                            or convince you that Drake is the best opera singer the world has ever known.
                            <br /><br />
                            So where do I start?
                            <br /><br />
                            I was told to read more books. Download more words into my tiny brain. Gather more facts and ideas until they overflow
                            into coherent sentences. If that were true I should be able to make a blockbuster movie since I spent half my life
                            watching Netflix and Youtube (admit it you have too!).
                            <br /><br />
                            Maybe I should practice writing. (Is it practice or practise? English why do you hate me so much?)
                            <br /><br />
                            More words I write the better I'll get at it. Maybe I need a coach to help me along. Micheal Jordan, who's arguably the
                            best basketball player in the world, had an amazing coach and practiced every day. I want to be 'Just like Mike' but with
                            my sentences. I know I can get this skill. One word at a time, one sentence at a time. There is always a path to success I
                            just need to seek it out.
                            <br /><br />
                            I will start will a simple sentence, this is where I will begin my journey:
                            <br /><br />
                            "I can't write."
                            <br /><br />

                            “Most of us have two lives. The life we live, and the unlived life within us. Between the
                            two stands Resistance.” <br />
                            <a href="https://www.amazon.ca/War-Art-Through-Creative-Battles/dp/1936891026"><i>Steven
                                    Pressfield: The War of Art</i></a><br /><br />

                            This is where I shall begin:<br /><br />

                            The hardest part is to start. You need to start somewhere and this is a good place to start
                            the journey. Let me tell you, starting is hard. Ever wake up on a Monday morning and want to
                            fall right back to sleep? Just the thought of dragging yourself to the cold bathroom from
                            your warm and cozy bed is equivalent to climbing Mount Everest in January during a biting
                            blizzard. Once you start the journey, you have to avoid the traps and pitfalls of
                            notifications from your phone, beckoning you to read a text message, view an instagram
                            picture, or an email claiming that a Nigerian prince can give you a million dollars for
                            helping him. Or the endless chores that need to be tended to, to keep your life organized
                            such as the piles of laundry that need to be folded, a mountain of dishes that need to be
                            washed and dried, a broken appliance or a hinge that needs to be fixed.<br /><br />

                            However, that’s not the obstacle, that’s far from it. There are only two reasons why we
                            don’t start:<br /><br />

                            1. Fear<br>
                            2. Procrastination<br /><br />

                            Fear of failure, fear of being wrong, fear of not knowing enough, fear of looking bad, fear
                            of risk taking. We also procrastinate, we will start in the afternoon, start this weekend,
                            when it’s summer, when the kids are older, when the economy is better, after you finish
                            reading another book. Imagine if you could let go of your fears and just do it - get over
                            the resistance - imagine what your life could be.
