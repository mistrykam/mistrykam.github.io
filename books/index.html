                                    An alternative way of looking at what wealth is and the path ways to achieve it. The most important thing we have
                                    in life is time and we shouldn’t waste it chasing consumer goods to impress people. Our focus should be on
                                    experiences and relationships. This book gives a step-by-step process on how to become part of the New Rich. There
                                    are numerous takeaways from this book - one big idea is the 80/20 rule: where 80% of the result comes from 20%
                                    effort (Pareto Principle). If you identify and focus your attention on the 20% you greatly reduce the time it
                                    takes to achieve success.

                                    Reading this book shifts your understanding of income generation. Robert, when he is young gets advice from his
                                    “Rich Dad” and “Poor Dad”. His “Poor Dad” focuses on the traditional path: to do well in school, then get a degree
                                    and then find a corporate job to work at until retirement. While working he should save a little on the side until
                                    the big freedom day of retirement. His “Rich Dad” explains that being an employee is the slow path to wealth. You
                                    must become a business owner or an investor to be wealthy. It’s better to own or invest in a factory than be a
                                    factory worker.

                                    This book is about FIRE: Financial Independence, Retire Early. The goal of FIRE is to save aggressively, invest in
                                    a balanced portfolio in order to retire early. The book lays out the author’s journey from being in poverty,
                                    graduating as an engineer, and then getting sucked into a consumer-led life-styled (buying expensive hand-bags was
                                    her poison). When she and her husband went housing hunting they quickly realized that they would be in heavily in
                                    debt and their dreams of traveling would be impossible with a house. There was an alternative and they explain how
                                    they achieved their financial goals. The author also has an excellent blog called “Millennial Revolution” which
                                    has a wealth of information.

                                    This is a must-read book for anyone who wants to understand how to influence and persuade people. Robert lays out
                                    7 principles of persuasion: reciprocation, commitment & consistency, social proof, liking, authority, scarcity,
                                    unity. After reading this book you will be more aware of how marketers have used these principles to influence us
                                    to purchase their product or service. When these psychological tactics are used by salesmen, waiters, car dealers,
                                    etc., influences us into saying yes to which we would have normally said no.
